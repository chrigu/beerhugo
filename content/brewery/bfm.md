Brasserie des Franches-Montagnes (BFM)

Franches-Montagnes Brewery (Brasserie des Franches-Montagnes (BFM)) is a small artisanal brewery in Saignelégier, Jura, Switzerland whose products, including barrel-aged beers, have drawn international acclaim.[1] Founded in 1997 by Jérôme Rebetez, who had formerly been trained as an oenologist, the brewery is known for making beers that stray outside traditional beer style guidelines and use unorthodox ingredients.
